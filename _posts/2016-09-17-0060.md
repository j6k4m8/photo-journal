The FitMango office is walking-distance from my home in Mount Vernon, which is awesome in general but sucky when it's hot or humid (which it is in Baltimore 97% of the time, until it plunges to a mysterious -35ºF but still somehow atrociously humid).

So I walk past this music shop every day.

Once I walked in to try and find a classical guitar, and I was so intimidated that I left almost immediately and now I'm even more intimidated to go back.

Taking photos every step of the way is a really interesting way of remembering that I live in a beautiful neighborhood.

One of the cool things about Mount Vernon is that George Washington looks like he's flipping everyone the bird from this angle.

Before I get to my office, I walk past Sugarvale, a really neat (literally underground) bar.

Here's the FitMango office itself — the old rowhouse mansion of the fellow who actually organized the building of the Peabody Institute while George Peabody himself was busy being British and not living in Baltimore.

Neat electronic keys to get in. They work about 2% of the time.

...aaaaaaaaand......shit. I forgot my office keys.

This is me and my bag, reflecting on the error of our ways.

**But it is no problem! This means I get to go to a coffeeshop instead!**

Gonna meet Anniefriend there, it seems. All is going according to plan...just, not _my_ plan, necessarily.
