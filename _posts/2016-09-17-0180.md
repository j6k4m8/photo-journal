Another concierge took over for Camille a few minutes ago: Her name is Nicole and she is from Belgium. I've been to Belgium once, and it seems like the sort of place from which Nicole ought to be from: Quiet, for the most-part, and French.

If I had to guess where she were from and I didn't know, Belgium would be first on my list, after accidentally asking if she was Israeli (I got that vibe for some reason, even though the odds are infinitesimal) and then reverting to asking if she was French, which was _dramatically_ closer, but still definitely not correct.

Nicole says her name like "Ni?ole", where the "?" represents that sort of French sound that French people (and Belgian people) make with their mouth parts that sounds kind of like exhale-phlegming but in a comforting and warm way.

- NI?OLE: Are you a student?
- ME: I'm just graduated, now I'm a software developer for a technology company—
- NI?OLE: Ah, not too many snakes!

This is, I think, a French figure of speech for a cushy job: That's the feeling I got from her. But I also got "Israeli" from her, so I perhaps have a skewed understanding of the world around me.

This is a photo journal, not a dissertation, so here's a photo of Ni?ole saying 'Ah — not too menne sneks!'
