I bought an espresso mojito. This is amongst the more expensive coffee drinks I've ever purchased.

I had a dream last night that I went on a date at 4:21 am, and we had too many mimosas and threw up. And when I looked at myself in the mirror, my hair had grown way out and it was grey, and I wondered when that had happened and what it meant about my life, symbolically.

This espresso mojito does not have alcohol in it; it's just got grapefruit and mint and lime and espresso and _seems_ like a mojito.

To convey to the world around me that the price of this drink is absurd, I sign my name as a cartoon godzilla.

Ceremony Coffee is like what the Apple Store would look like if they sold coffee. Oh, you want a cappuccino? Sure, but it doesn't come with earbuds. And the foam is bluetooth _only_.

This is what an espresso mojito looks like. On the left, I am running `htop`, a terminal command that makes it look like I'm doing more complicated things than I am.

In reality, I'm writing an artificial-intelligence system for FitMango.

We have a ton of data relating when people want to go to the gym, or to a yoga class, or to a nutritionist: Our secret sauce is that we can predict when people will want to do these things before they actually tell us, so that we can tailor our services around their preferences without anyone ever having to ask anyone else how they feel about anything.
