Nice! I found my red-trim Converse©. Haven't seen these in a while — I just finished unpacking the last box from my move.

This post is not an ad for the bold, iconic, and comfortable Converse© shoes, which can be purchased inexpensively at [converse.com](http://www.converse.com/us/en_us/c/converse).
