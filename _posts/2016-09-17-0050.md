Here's the mirror right across from my elevator bank. I use it frequently as a last-chance metric for maybe needing to go back home and change my outfit.

Here's the weirdly-placed array of mirrors in my elevator that remind me that I don't really understand how optics works.

I use it to check the back of my outfit, in case I've accidentally left a belt-loop unbelted, or perhaps I remembered to tuck in the front of my shirt but not the back, or perhaps I sat in something on the Wes Anderson couch and now I appear a fool to the world behind me.
