We have a little chillax-spot in the lobby of my building — on my first day in the building, I met a cute cellist there and so I assumed it was going to play a large role in my life. As it turns out, my first day in the building was her last, and since then I've yet to encounter another human anywhere in this area.

It has one of those to-hell-with-the-environment-i-want-coffee-from-a-plastic-package machines, but you have to supply your own mug.

Here's a picture of me with my mug waiting for the elevator. The mug has about a quarter of an inch of milk in it for my coffee.

The building has five elevators. Five. Which means that you almost never — if ever — ride with another person. The frequency of elevator requests is, in my experience, less than one request per elevator, so you could ride up and down naked in one of the elevators all day and no one would ever notice.

Today, someone was in my elevator with me. I live on the top floor, which makes this even less likely.

Nevertheless, there they stood, awkwardly eyeing me and my quarter-inch mug of room-temperature milk.

Here's a picture of me after they got out of the elevator. You can see my shame reflected infinitely in every direction:

Here are the different types of coffee plastics you can have:

As you can see, many of these coffees are artificially flavored, and many of these coffees are tea. If you want a coffee, you get a plastic liquid something like coffee. Even if you want tea, you get a plastic liquid something like coffee. The world is a very big, confusing place, but here, everything is easy to understand. (As Douglas Adams would say: "Somewhat, but not entirely unlike, tea.")

Here is a picture of the robot that is making my drink for me:

This is me, working in this room with my coffee-like drink:

This is me again, having accidentally set the timer for three seconds instead of ten:
