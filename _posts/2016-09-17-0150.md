After living one block away for months and never being able to step inside the store, I finally went back to Ted's with my guitar.

This is Ted's. The window to the left is what I thought was a cute cafe, but my friend explained to me it was a lesbian bar and I'd likely not be welcome. I didn't realize that was a thing, which seems insensitive of me. But I also am understanding of why people would want their own bar â€” that's why there's such thing as jazzbars, or crowbars.

Here's my guitar: Fernando explained to me that it was junk, which is about what I expected someone named Fernando at a music store next to the Peabody Institute to say about anything I own. He explained that he would have to surgically remove my entire guitar in order for it to sound good, but that I was completely right, the action was too high to be able to play comfortably.

For $21 and some insults, I've never been happier.
