Annie convinced me to go to Ted's so we went and I asked them about my guitar being too hard for me to play and they were super chill and told me to bring it in and they'd take a look at it and Annie bought a drum-pad so she can paradiddle and that's not even a euphemism, she says.

Then we went back to my house which is where I live, because Annie hasn't been in this place before.

Here she is, in a Wes Anderson movie:

I'm getting so much less work done today than I planned.
