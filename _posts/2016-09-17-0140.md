I dropped off Annie with her friend. Here is a picture of us in the elevator mirror that I showed you before.

This is Annie with her friend. She's saying "take the picture already" but I'm not used to this phone so it took me a while.

I caption this one, "hey guys wait I need to take a picture of you leaving for my photo journal"

Costume change: I am now wearing my _artsy_ glasses, and a guitar.

Random passerby want to know if I play guitar. I probably do!
