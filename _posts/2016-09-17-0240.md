An anachronism: I took this video before but just figured out how to make it a gif.

Another anachronism: Since my phone finally synced to ___THE CLOUD___ and I can see my photos on my laptop:

This is where Paul Revere died. Not technically in the church, which was born after he died, but in that location; he came to visit his daughter or something — I don't remember precisely what, my mother told me this story after visiting and touring around Mount Vernon while I was at work — anyway, the point is that he died there, and then they got rid of the building where he died and put a church there, and now there's a church there until something happens that prompts them to put the house back.

My friend told me that Dan Deacon performed here once, and hooked the pipe organ up as a synth, but now I don't remember who told me. Possibly it was you?

Anyhow, whomever it was, I know that every time I walk past that church with them, one of us says to the other, "did you know that Dan Deacon performed here once, and hooked the pipe organ up as a synth," to which the other replies, "I thought _I_ told _you_ that."
