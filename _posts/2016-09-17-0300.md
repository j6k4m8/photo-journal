We grabbed dinner at Bar Clavel, and looked on as Lane Harlan totally _owned_ the place, both fiscally and psychologically.

...the evening quickly devolves into a bar-crawl. Here's Chris at Sugarvale, in a fantastic display of Chekhov's Bar. (Any bar which is shown in one scene must be shot in a subsequent scene. Or something. There's a joke about shots here, but it's probably not a very good joke.)

After that, we explored Owl Bar, an actual-speakeasy (although these days, it's more sports-bar).

Here, I took my favorite picture of the entire day â€” I just wish it had come out less blurry. (Actually, I had to pretend to be on the phone, with my camera on video mode, in order to surreptitiously get this shot.) This dude and his date are full-on making out, while the third-wheel is sleeping in her elbow across the table.

After that, discussion about:

- Electric cars
- Hyperloop
- Private equity
- #startuplyfe
- Let's do this again really soon

A quick walk home, past Washington. From this angle, he's not flipping us off; and that street light is just a street light, not a moon.
