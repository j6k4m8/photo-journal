I won it at a Google event, and so it's loudly branded with a Google typemark on the front. Other than being a bit more San-Francisco-You're-The-Reason-This-City's-Going-Down-The-Crapper than I'd like, this is a great bag. It's a 24-liter, which apparently is big, although I don't really have a frame of reference for that type of volume other than the mental image of someone pouring twelve two-liter soda-bottles into my backpack, which is where I break down and beg them not to ruin my things.

"Ruin your teeth," I cry — "but please, spare my notebook!" Soda is a killer.

Here's the inside of my backpack:

It has a laptop pocket, which is slightly suspended so that if I drop my bag (which I do often), the laptop doesn't actually hit the ground. And it has that nice pen pocket, which I've filled with FitMango pens (my company) to hand out when people ask me what I do.

I own a startup — I have a hard time reminding myself of that, because I really don't _own_ it. Like, financially, sure, but psychologically _owning_ it? Soylent as a concept makes me feel dirty and usually I just tell people I write code. I'm a bad marketer, I suspect.

The rest of the backback is actually kinda meh. Aside from one pocket on the top (clearly _either_ a keys pocket or a phone pocket, but not both because they'll just mash up against each other and fight) and the laptop and pen pockets on the inside, there are no other pockets or little storagey thingies. I guess Google thought I'd be doing a lot of backpacking?

That's the sort of "I'm a coder but really I just _adore_ the outdoors more than you know!" fake attitude that makes me think that probably I'm not cut out for startup life and I should go back to being an elderly Scottish woman whom everyone thinks is a witch, as was my original plan.
